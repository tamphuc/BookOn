                            <h1>Chapter 3: George returning to the bunkhouse </h1>
                            <p>
                                At the end of the workday, Slim and George return to the bunkhouse. Slim has agreed to give one of the pups to Lennie, and George thanks him for his kindness, insisting that Lennie is “dumb as hell,” but is neither crazy nor mean. Slim appreciates George’s friendship with Lennie, saying that it is a welcome change in a world where no one ever “seems to give a damn about nobody.” George confides in Slim the story of how he and Lennie came to be companions. They were born in the same town, and George took charge of Lennie after the death of Lennie’s Aunt Clara. At first, George admits, he pushed Lennie around, getting him to do ridiculous things, such as jumping into a river even though he didn’t know how to swim. After watching his friend nearly drown, George felt ashamed of his behavior. Since that day, he has taken good care of his companion, protecting him even when he gets in trouble. For example, in Weed, the last town where they worked, Lennie wanted to touch the fabric of a girl’s red dress. When she pulled away, Lennie became frightened and held on to her until George hit him over the head to make him let go. The girl accused Lennie of rape, and George and Lennie had to hide in an irrigation ditch to escape a lynch mob.

                                Alex, a former college chancellor, had zero expertise in the eld
                                of computer science. At the time, that wasn’t unusual, but
                                Alexhimself certainly was. He naïvely thought that computers
                                would soon replace people, and leading that charge was what
                                excited him. (We knew this was a misconception, if a common one
                                at that point, but we were grateful for his eagerness to fund
                                our work.) He had a bizarre way of speaking that mixed bluster,
                                non sequiturs, and even snippets of rhyming verse into a sort of
                                Mad Hatter–ish patois—or “word salad,” as one of my colleagues
                                called it. (“Our vision will speed up time,” he would say,
                                “eventually deleting it.”) Those of us who worked with him often
                                had trouble understanding what he meant. Alex had a secret
                                ambition—well, not so secret. He said almost every day that he
                                didn’t want to be the next Walt Disney, which only made us all
                                think that he did. When I arrived, he was in the process of
                                directing a hand-drawn animated movie called Tubby the Tuba.
                                Really, the thing never had a chance—no one at NYIT had the
                                training or the story sensibility to make a lm, and when it was
                                nally released, it vanished without a trace.

                                Deluded though he may have been about his own skills, Alex was a
                                visionary. He was incredibly prescient about the role computers
                                would someday play in animation, and he was willing to spend a
                                lot of his own money to push that vision forward. His unwavering
                                commitment to what many labeled a pipe dream—the melding of
                                technology and this hand-drawn art form—enabled much
                                groundbreaking work to be done. Once Alex brought me in, he left
                                it to me to assemble a team. I have to give that to him: He had
                                total con dence in the people he hired. This was something I
                                admired and, later, sought to do myself. One of the rst people I
                                interviewed was Alvy Ray Smith, a charismatic Texan with a Ph.D.
                                in computer science and a sparkling resume that included
                                teaching stints at New York University and UC Berkeley and a gig
                                at Xerox PARC, the distinguished R&D lab in Palo Alto. I had con
                                icting feelings when I met Alvy because, frankly, he seemed more
                                quali ed to lead the lab than I was. I can still remember the
                                uneasiness in my gut, that instinctual twinge spurred by a
                                potential threat: This, I thought, could be the guy who takes my
                                job one day. I hired him anyway.
