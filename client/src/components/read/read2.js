                                The next day, Lennie and George make their way to the ranch bunkhouse, where they are greeted by Candy, an aging “swamper,” or handyman, who has lost his right hand. The bunkhouse is an unadorned building where the men sleep on “burlap ticking” and keep their few possessions in apple boxes that have been nailed to the walls. George is dismayed to find a can of lice powder in his bunk, but Candy assures him that he’s in no danger of being infested, since the man who slept there before George was remarkably clean. George asks about the boss, and Candy reports that although the boss was angry that George and Lennie did not arrive the previous night as he had expected them to, he can be a “pretty nice fella.” Candy relates how the boss gave the men a gallon of whiskey for Christmas, which immediately impresses George.

                                Alex, a former college chancellor, had zero expertise in the eld
                                of computer science. At the time, that wasn’t unusual, but
                                Alexhimself certainly was. He naïvely thought that computers
                                would soon replace people, and leading that charge was what
                                excited him. (We knew this was a misconception, if a common one
                                at that point, but we were grateful for his eagerness to fund
                                our work.) He had a bizarre way of speaking that mixed bluster,
                                non sequiturs, and even snippets of rhyming verse into a sort of
                                Mad Hatter–ish patois—or “word salad,” as one of my colleagues
                                called it. (“Our vision will speed up time,” he would say,
                                “eventually deleting it.”) Those of us who worked with him often
                                had trouble understanding what he meant. Alex had a secret
                                ambition—well, not so secret. He said almost every day that he
                                didn’t want to be the next Walt Disney, which only made us all
                                think that he did. When I arrived, he was in the process of
                                directing a hand-drawn animated movie called Tubby the Tuba.
                                Really, the thing never had a chance—no one at NYIT had the
                                training or the story sensibility to make a lm, and when it was
                                nally released, it vanished without a trace.

                                Deluded though he may have been about his own skills, Alex was a
                                visionary. He was incredibly prescient about the role computers
                                would someday play in animation, and he was willing to spend a
                                lot of his own money to push that vision forward. His unwavering
                                commitment to what many labeled a pipe dream—the melding of
                                technology and this hand-drawn art form—enabled much
                                groundbreaking work to be done. Once Alex brought me in, he left
                                it to me to assemble a team. I have to give that to him: He had
                                total con dence in the people he hired. This was something I
                                admired and, later, sought to do myself. One of the rst people I
                                interviewed was Alvy Ray Smith, a charismatic Texan with a Ph.D.
                                in computer science and a sparkling resume that included
                                teaching stints at New York University and UC Berkeley and a gig
                                at Xerox PARC, the distinguished R&D lab in Palo Alto. I had con
                                icting feelings when I met Alvy because, frankly, he seemed more
                                quali ed to lead the lab than I was. I can still remember the
                                uneasiness in my gut, that instinctual twinge spurred by a
                                potential threat: This, I thought, could be the guy who takes my
                                job one day. I hired him anyway.
