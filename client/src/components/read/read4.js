                                At the end of the workday, Slim and George return to the bunkhouse. Slim has agreed to give one of the pups to Lennie, and George thanks him for his kindness, insisting that Lennie is “dumb as hell,” but is neither crazy nor mean. Slim appreciates George’s friendship with Lennie, saying that it is a welcome change in a world where no one ever “seems to give a damn about nobody.” George confides in Slim the story of how he and Lennie came to be companions. They were born in the same town, and George took charge of Lennie after the death of Lennie’s Aunt Clara. At first, George admits, he pushed Lennie around, getting him to do ridiculous things, such as jumping into a river even though he didn’t know how to swim. After watching his friend nearly drown, George felt ashamed of his behavior. Since that day, he has taken good care of his companion, protecting him even when he gets in trouble. For example, in Weed, the last town where they worked, Lennie wanted to touch the fabric of a girl’s red dress. When she pulled away, Lennie became frightened and held on to her until George hit him over the head to make him let go. The girl accused Lennie of rape, and George and Lennie had to hide in an irrigation ditch to escape a lynch mob.

                                Crooks, the black stable-hand, comes in and tells Slim that he has warmed some tar to put on a mule’s foot. After Slim leaves, the other men play cards and discuss Curley’s wife, agreeing that she will make trouble for someone; as George says, “She’s a jailbait all set on the trigger.” Whit invites George to accompany them to a local whorehouse the following night. Whit discusses the merits of old Susy’s place over Clara’s, it being cheaper and having nice chairs, but George comments that he cannot afford to waste his money because he and Lennie are trying to put together a “stake.” Lennie and Carlson come in. Carlson cleans his gun and avoids looking at Candy. Curley appears looking for his wife again. Full of jealousy and suspicion, he asks where Slim is. When he learns that Slim is in the barn, he storms off in that direction, followed by Whit and Carlson, who hope to see a fight.

                                Deluded though he may have been about his own skills, Alex was a
                                visionary. He was incredibly prescient about the role computers
                                would someday play in animation, and he was willing to spend a
                                lot of his own money to push that vision forward. His unwavering
                                commitment to what many labeled a pipe dream—the melding of
                                technology and this hand-drawn art form—enabled much
                                groundbreaking work to be done. Once Alex brought me in, he left
                                it to me to assemble a team. I have to give that to him: He had
                                total con dence in the people he hired. This was something I
                                admired and, later, sought to do myself. One of the rst people I
                                interviewed was Alvy Ray Smith, a charismatic Texan with a Ph.D.
                                in computer science and a sparkling resume that included
                                teaching stints at New York University and UC Berkeley and a gig
                                at Xerox PARC, the distinguished R&D lab in Palo Alto. I had con
                                icting feelings when I met Alvy because, frankly, he seemed more
                                quali ed to lead the lab than I was. I can still remember the
                                uneasiness in my gut, that instinctual twinge spurred by a
                                potential threat: This, I thought, could be the guy who takes my
                                job one day. I hired him anyway.
